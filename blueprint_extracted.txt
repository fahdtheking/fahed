•Comprehensive Automation: The agent automates live voice interviews, transcribes responses, analyzes for fraud and tone, and assigns a trust score,
streamlining the entire supplier verification process.
•Open-Source Powerhouse: Built entirely with free and open-source tools like OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text and Hugging Face Transformers for AI
analysis, ensuring cost-effectiveness and flexibility.
•Enhanced Security and Trust: By actively detecting fraud patterns, analyzing supplier honesty, and assigning trust scores, the system significantly enhances
platform security and builds a more trustworthy marketplace.
The DropPay Real-Time Supplier Verification AI Agent represents a significant leap forward in automated supplier management. This intelligent system is
designed to transform the often manual and time-consuming process of vetting new suppliers into a streamlined, secure, and highly efficient operation. By
leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence, the agent conducts live voice interviews, meticulously transcribes every word, and then applies sophisticated
analytical models to evaluate responses for critical indicators such as fraud patterns, tone, and overall honesty. The culmination of this analysis is a trust score,
which serves as the basis for automated decisions: whether to approve, flag for further review, or outright reject a supplier.
This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire implementation process, from setting up your development environment to integrating the final AI agent
with your existing platform. We will focus exclusively on free and open-source tools, making this powerful technology accessible without significant financial
investment. Given your access to Pica, we will also explore how this platform can seamlessly integrate into various stages of the agent's workflow, acting as a
crucial component for orchestrating communication and data flow within your intelligent marketplace.

 Figure 1: Conceptual Mindmap of the DropPay Supplier Verification AI Agent Architecture
 The mindmap above visually represents the interconnected components that form the backbone of your AI agent. It highlights how voice input flows through
transcription, sophisticated AI analysis, and eventually leads to an automated decision based on a calculated trust score. The integration layer ensures seamless
communication with your existing platform, while a feedback loop allows for continuous improvement.

Phase 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment
Laying the Groundwork for AI Development
The first crucial step is to establish a robust and isolated development environment. Python is the de facto standard for AI and machine learning, making it the
ideal choice for this project. Using a virtual environment ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated from other Python projects on your system,
preventing conflicts.
Step 1.1: Install Python and Set Up a Virtual Environment
Python will be the programming language for your AI agent. Ensure you have a recent version installed (Python 3.9+ is recommended).
•Download Python: Navigate to python.org/downloads/ and download the latest stable version for your operating system (e.g., Python 3.12). Follow the installer
prompts, ensuring you select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
Create a Virtual Environment: Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to your desired project directory (or create a new one, e.g., mkdir
droppay_agent and then cd droppay_agent). Then, execute the following commands:
python -m venv supplier_agent_env
cd supplier_agent_env
Activate the Virtual Environment: This step makes sure all subsequent installations are confined to this specific project environment.
# On Windows:
Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source bin/activate
•You should see (supplier_agent_env) preceding your terminal prompt, indicating successful activation.
•Integrated Development Environment (IDE): For coding, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, free, and highly extensible IDE with excellent Python
support. Download it from code.visualstudio.com/download.
Step 1.2: Database Setup for Data Storage
Your AI agent will generate and process various data points—interview audio paths, transcribed text, analysis results, trust scores, and decisions. A database is
essential for persistent storage.
Option 1 (Simple & Free for Prototyping): SQLite
SQLite is a file-based database, meaning no separate server setup is required. It's excellent for small to medium-sized projects or initial development. Python
has a built-in module for SQLite (sqlite3).
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('supplier_agent.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
# Create table (run once)
cursor.execute('''
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS suppliers (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       supplier_name TEXT,
       interview_audio_path TEXT,
       transcription TEXT,
       fraud_flags INTEGER,
       inconsistencies INTEGER,
       sentiment_score REAL,
       verification_status BOOLEAN,
       trust_score REAL,
       decision TEXT,
       timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   )
''')
conn.commit()
conn.close() # Close connection after creating table
Option 2 (Scalable & Free): PostgreSQL
For more robust, scalable production environments, PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database. It requires installation on a server (which can
be your local machine or a cloud VM).

•Installation (Ubuntu example): sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
Python Library: Install the necessary Python connector within your virtual environment:
pip install psycopg2-binary
Phase 2: Building the Core AI Components
From Voice to Intelligent Insights
This phase covers the heart of your AI agent: converting speech to text and then analyzing that text for crucial verification signals.
 
 Figure 2: AI-powered interviews, like the one imagined for supplier verification, streamline and enhance the onboarding process.
 Step 2.1: Setting Up Speech-to-Text with OpenAI Whisper
OpenAI's Whisper is an excellent open-source model for highly accurate speech-to-text transcription. It's free to use and powerful.
Install Whisper: In your activated virtual environment, run:
pip install openai-whisper
pip install numpy pyaudio sounddevice scipy
pyaudio, sounddevice, and scipy are crucial for recording and handling audio input.
Create a Transcription Script (transcribe_audio.py):
import whisper 
import sounddevice as sd 
from scipy.io.wavfile import write 
import numpy as np 
 
# Load Whisper model (choose 'base' for a good balance of speed and accuracy) 
# Other options: 'tiny', 'small', 'medium', 'large' (larger models are more accurate but slower) 
model = whisper.load_model("base") 
 
def record_audio(duration=15, filename="supplier_response.wav", samplerate=44100, channels=1): 
   """Records audio from the microphone for a specified duration.""" 
   print(f"Recording for {duration} seconds... Please speak clearly.") 
   # Ensure dtype is float32 for sounddevice compatibility 
   recording = sd.rec(int(duration * samplerate), samplerate=samplerate, channels=channels, dtype='float32') 
   sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished 
   write(filename, samplerate, recording)  # Save as WAV file 
   print("Recording complete.") 
   return filename 
 
def transcribe_audio_file(audio_filepath): 
   """Transcribes an audio file using Whisper.""" 
   print(f"Transcribing {audio_filepath}...") 
   try: 
       result = model.transcribe(audio_filepath)

       transcription = result["text"] 
       print(f"Transcription: {transcription}") 
       return transcription 
   except Exception as e: 
       print(f"Error during transcription: {e}") 
       return "" 
 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
   audio_file_path = record_audio() 
   transcribed_text = transcribe_audio_file(audio_file_path) 
   print("\n--- Transcription Test Result ---") 
   print(f"Raw transcription: {transcribed_text}")
Save this as transcribe_audio.py and test it by running python transcribe_audio.py in your terminal. Speak for 15 seconds, and you should see
the transcription.
Step 2.2: Building the AI Analysis and Fraud Detection Module
This is where the intelligence of your agent truly shines. We'll use Hugging Face's transformers library, which provides access to numerous pre-trained
open-source language models for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and potentially feature extraction for fraud detection.
Install Hugging Face Transformers:
pip install transformers torch scikit-learn
torch is a deep learning framework required by many transformer models, and scikit-learn will be useful for any classification or anomaly detection
algorithms if you decide to train custom models.
Create an Analysis Script (analyze_text.py):
from transformers import pipeline 
import re 
 
# Initialize sentiment analysis pipeline 
# 'sentiment-analysis' uses a default model like 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english' 
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis") 
 
def detect_fraud_patterns(text): 
   """ 
   Detects basic fraud indicators based on keywords, phrases, or linguistic inconsistencies. 
   This is a simplified example; real-world fraud detection is more complex. 
   """ 
   # Example suspicious keywords/phrases common in fraudulent claims or evasive answers 
   suspicious_phrases = [

       r'anonymous' # Concealment of identity 
   ] 
    
   fraud_flags = 0 
   detected_patterns = [] 
 
   for pattern in suspicious_phrases: 
       if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE): 
           fraud_flags += 1

           detected_patterns.append(re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE).group(0)) 
 
   # Simple check for inconsistent numbers (e.g., conflicting production capacity claims) 
   # This would require more sophisticated context awareness for a real scenario 
   numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text) 
   if len(set(numbers)) > 1 and len(numbers) > 1: # If multiple distinct numbers, might need deeper check 
       # Placeholder for real inconsistency logic:

       pass 
 
   return fraud_flags, detected_patterns

   print(f"Trust Score: {trust_score_e}") 
   print(f"Decision: {decision_e}")
Save this as analyze_text.py. This script provides a basic framework. The detect_fraud_patterns function uses regular expressions to identify
suspicious keywords and phrases. The analyze_tone function leverages a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to infer the emotional leaning of the
supplier's response. Finally, calculate_trust_score combines these insights into a numerical score, which then informs the make_decision function.
Phase 3: Orchestrating the Agent Workflow and Integration
Bringing It All Together with APIs and Your Platform
Now that the core components are ready, we'll integrate them into a cohesive workflow and expose this functionality via an API, making it accessible to your
platform, including Pica.
Step 3.1: Building the Main AI Agent Script
This script will serve as the central orchestrator, bringing together the audio recording, transcription, and analysis components.
Create supplier_agent.py:
import transcribe_audio 
import analyze_text 
import os 
import sqlite3 # Or psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL 
 
def initiate_supplier_interview(supplier_name="New Supplier"): 
   """ 
   Conducts a simulated live voice interview, transcribes, analyzes, 
   calculates trust score, makes a decision, and stores results.

   # 1. Record Audio 
   audio_filename = f"supplier_interview_{supplier_name.replace(' ', '_')}.wav" 
   recorded_file_path = transcribe_audio.record_audio(filename=audio_filename) 
 
   # 2. Transcribe Audio 
   transcribed_text = transcribe_audio.transcribe_audio_file(recorded_file_path) 
 
   # 3. Analyze Transcribed Text 
   print("\n--- Analyzing response for fraud and tone ---") 
   fraud_flags, detected_patterns = analyze_text.detect_fraud_patterns(transcribed_text) 
   tone_label, tone_score = analyze_text.analyze_tone(transcribed_text) 
 
   # (Placeholder for real-world consistency check, requires deeper NLP) 
   consistency_issues = 0 
   # (Placeholder for external verification, e.g., API calls to business registries) 
   external_verification_status = True # Assume true for now 
 
   # 4. Calculate Trust Score 
   trust_score = analyze_text.calculate_trust_score( 
       fraud_flags, tone_label, tone_score, 
       consistency_issues=consistency_issues, 
       external_verification_status=external_verification_status 
   ) 
 
   # 5. Make Decision 
   decision = analyze_text.make_decision(trust_score) 
 
   print("\n--- Interview Results ---") 
   print(f"Supplier: {supplier_name}") 
   print(f"Transcription: {transcribed_text}") 
   print(f"Fraud Flags: {fraud_flags} (Patterns: {', '.join(detected_patterns) if detected_patterns else 'None'})") 
   print(f"Tone: {tone_label} (Score: {tone_score:.2f})") 
   print(f"Calculated Trust Score: {trust_score}/100") 
   print(f"Final Decision: {decision}") 
 
   # 6. Store Results in Database 
   try: 
       conn = sqlite3.connect('supplier_agent.db') 
       cursor = conn.cursor() 
       cursor.execute(''' 
           INSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_name, interview_audio_path, transcription, fraud_flags, inconsistencies, sentiment_score, verification_status, trust_score, decision) 
           VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) 
       ''', (supplier_name, recorded_file_path, transcribed_text, fraud_flags, consistency_issues, tone_score, external_verification_status, trust_score, decision)) 
       conn.commit() 
       print("Results saved to database.") 
   except Exception as e: 
       print(f"Error saving to database: {e}") 
   finally: 
       if conn: 
           conn.close() 
 
   # Clean up the audio file if no longer needed 
   if os.path.exists(recorded_file_path): 
       os.remove(recorded_file_path) 
 
   return {"supplier_name": supplier_name, "trust_score": trust_score, "decision": decision} 
 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
   # Example usage: 
   # This simulates running the interview directly. 
   # In a real setup, this would be triggered via an API endpoint. 
   initiate_supplier_interview("Acme Solutions Inc.") 
   initiate_supplier_interview("Global Suppliers LLC")
Make sure transcribe_audio.py and analyze_text.py are in the same directory as this new script. This script orchestrates the entire process, from
recording to making a decision and saving the results. It also includes placeholders for more advanced features like external verification and consistency
checks.

Step 3.2: Exposing Functionality with a Web API (Flask/FastAPI)
To enable your platform (and Pica) to interact with your AI agent, you'll need to expose its functionality via a web API. Flask is a lightweight Python web
framework suitable for this.
Install Flask:
pip install Flask
Create an API Script (app.py):
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify 
import transcribe_audio 
import analyze_text 
import os 
import sqlite3 
 
app = Flask(__name__) 
 
# This function will be triggered by an API call 
@app.route('/verify_supplier', methods=['POST']) 
def verify_supplier_endpoint(): 
   # Expecting supplier_name in JSON payload or form data 
   supplier_name = request.json.get('supplier_name', 'Unknown Supplier') 
    
   # In a real-time voice interview scenario, audio would be streamed or 
   # provided as a file upload. For simplicity, we'll use the record_audio 
   # function directly within this endpoint for demonstration. 
   # For a production system with Pica, you'd integrate differently (see below). 
 
   try: 
       # 1. Record Audio (or receive streamed audio from Pica) 
       audio_filename = f"supplier_interview_{supplier_name.replace(' ', '_')}_{os.urandom(4).hex()}.wav" 
       recorded_file_path = transcribe_audio.record_audio(filename=audio_filename, duration=15) # Example: record for 15s 
 
       # 2. Transcribe Audio 
       transcribed_text = transcribe_audio.transcribe_audio_file(recorded_file_path) 
 
       # 3. Analyze Transcribed Text 
       fraud_flags, detected_patterns = analyze_text.detect_fraud_patterns(transcribed_text) 
       tone_label, tone_score = analyze_text.analyze_tone(transcribed_text) 
 
       consistency_issues = 0 # Placeholder 
       external_verification_status = True # Placeholder 
 
       # 4. Calculate Trust Score 
       trust_score = analyze_text.calculate_trust_score( 
           fraud_flags, tone_label, tone_score, 
           consistency_issues=consistency_issues, 
           external_verification_status=external_verification_status 
       ) 
 
       # 5. Make Decision 
       decision = analyze_text.make_decision(trust_score) 
 
       # 6. Store Results in Database 
       conn = None 
       try: 
           conn = sqlite3.connect('supplier_agent.db') 
           cursor = conn.cursor() 
           cursor.execute(''' 
               INSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_name, interview_audio_path, transcription, fraud_flags, inconsistencies, sentiment_score, verification_status, trust_score, decision)

           inconsistencies INTEGER, 
           sentiment_score REAL, 
           verification_status BOOLEAN, 
           trust_score REAL, 
           decision TEXT, 
           timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

   conn_init.commit() 
   conn_init.close() 
 
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000) # Run on all interfaces, port 5000
Save this as app.py. This API will listen for POST requests on /verify_supplier. When a request comes in, it triggers the entire verification process. For
testing, you can use tools like Postman or curl to send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/verify_supplier with a JSON body like
{"supplier_name": "Test Company"}.
Step 3.3: Integrating with Pica and Your Platform
Pica, as an "Agentic tooling platform" with "Natural Language Integrations" and "Drop-in Connection Component," can serve as a bridge between your front-end
and the AI agent's backend.
•Pica's Role in Voice Interaction: While our current API script initiates audio recording directly, in a true real-time setup, Pica might handle the live voice
session with the supplier. Pica could stream the audio to your Flask API, or provide the recorded audio file to your API via a webhook or a direct file upload.
You would configure a Pica workflow to trigger your /verify_supplier endpoint after a supplier interaction. Explore Pica's documentation for connecting
external APIs and utilizing its voice capabilities.
•Your Marketplace Integration: Your existing marketplace platform will interact with this Flask API. When a new supplier initiates onboarding, your platform can
send a request to /verify_supplier, providing the supplier's name. Your platform then awaits the JSON response containing the trust score and decision,
which can be used to update the supplier's status within your system (e.g., in an open-source vendor management system like Procuman, which you can find
details about at itarian.com).
Deployment for Accessibility: To make your Flask API accessible from Pica or your live platform, you'll need to deploy it. Free options include:
•Ngrok: For local testing and exposing your local server to the internet. Run ngrok http 5000 in a new terminal after starting your Flask app to get a
publicly accessible URL.
•Free Cloud Hosting (e.g., Render, Heroku free tier): These platforms allow you to deploy Python web applications for free, though with limitations on
uptime and resources. You would need to containerize your app (e.g., with Docker) for easy deployment.

 onboarding phase which our AI agent streamlines.
 This video from ServiceNow highlights the holistic view of supplier lifecycle management, emphasizing the critical role of robust onboarding and continuous risk
assessment. Our AI agent directly contributes to this by automating the initial verification and providing a trust score, setting the foundation for effective supplier
relationship management.
Phase 4: Enhancing and Refining Your AI Agent
Beyond the Basics: Scalability, Security, and Continuous Improvement
While the steps above provide a fully functional prototype, a production-ready system requires further considerations.
Scalability Considerations
Processing real-time audio and running AI models can be resource-intensive. For high volumes, consider:
•Cloud Services: While the focus is on free tools, cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure offer free tiers that might be sufficient for initial low-volume
production. For larger scale, consider services like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or managed Kubernetes.
•Docker and Containerization: Package your Flask application and its dependencies into a Docker container. This makes deployment consistent across
environments and facilitates scaling.
•Asynchronous Processing: For real-time interviews, consider using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) to handle audio streams and analysis
requests asynchronously, improving responsiveness and throughput.
 Figure 3: Comparison of Initial Open-Source AI Agent Capabilities vs. Commercial Solutions
 This radar chart illustrates the comparative strengths of an initial open-source AI agent build against more advanced or commercial solutions. While the
open-source agent excels in transcription accuracy and offers good scalability potential (given proper infrastructure), it may require further refinement in areas like
fraud detection robustness and nuanced tone analysis to match highly specialized commercial offerings. The goal is to continuously improve the open-source
agent's capabilities in these areas.
Security Best Practices
•Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive supplier data at rest (in your database) and in transit (using HTTPS for API calls).
•Access Control: Implement robust authentication and authorization for your API endpoints. Only authorized services (like your marketplace or Pica) should be
able to trigger the verification process.
•Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize any input received by your API to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
•Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging to track agent activity, identify errors, and detect suspicious behavior. Monitor your system for
performance bottlenecks and security incidents.
 Figure 4: Comparative Benefits of Different Onboarding Approaches
 This bar chart visually compares the benefits across different supplier onboarding methodologies. It highlights that an AI-powered agent significantly outperforms
traditional manual and even basic automated onboarding in terms of time saved, effectiveness in fraud prevention, and the overall supplier experience. This
underscores the transformative potential of implementing a system like the DropPay Real-Time Supplier Verification AI Agent.
Continuous Improvement and Iteration
•Data Collection and Labeling: Collect more data on supplier interviews, especially flagged cases, and manually label them as fraudulent or legitimate. This
labeled data is invaluable for fine-tuning your fraud detection models.
•Model Fine-tuning: Use your collected and labeled data to fine-tune the open-source NLP models (e.g., from Hugging Face) for better accuracy in fraud
detection and tone analysis specific to your use case. This will require more advanced machine learning techniques.
•Regular Updates: Keep your libraries and models updated to benefit from the latest improvements and security patches from the open-source community.
